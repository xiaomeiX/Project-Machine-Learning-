Topic to tackle and project problems: 

In different airports, airplane delays inevitably happen in different airports due to various reasons. 
These delays have great impacts on both passengers and airlines by causing increased travel time, increased expenses on food and lodging,
extra stress among passengers, a decrease in customer satisfaction, damage the airlineâ€™s reputation, and cause the airline to lose customers. 
Furthermore, these delays can cause higher operation costs in each airport and compensation for disrupted passengers. 
So, it is important to estimate the possible delay duration ahead to plan for extra operation cost,
and rank the risk of delay to rearrange the flight path ahead to improve customer satisfaction.  

To help understand more details of delays and cancellations in each airport due to various reasons, 
we will explore and analyze an airline delay dataset based on different airports, and build machine learning regression models to predict the possible delay duration. 
Also, we will rank each airport and build a classification model and neural network to see the delay risk for each airport.
